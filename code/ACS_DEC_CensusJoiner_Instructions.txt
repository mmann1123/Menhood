ACS_DEC_CensusJoiner instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are step by step instruction to use the code used for the menhood project.
This is assuming the user runs the file at all at once. Before you start the file, 
it would be a good idea to locate the following file paths and files.

* R:\Cowan Research\Menhood_Census\MaxWork\ACS_DEC_CSV\Census_CSV_Shape_Joiner
** The py sheet to run and create shapefiles

* R:\Cowan Research\Menhood_Census\MaxWork\ACS_DEC_CSV
** this file path includes all the csv files used for the project

* R:\Cowan Research\Menhood_Census\MaxWork\ACS_DEC_CSV\CensusShapeFiles
** Folder that has the shapefile used to make a layer that we then save with joined
** variables

* R:\Cowan Research\Menhood_Census\MaxWork\MenhoodVariablesList_v3.xlsx
** File that includes all variable Id and corresponding GeoId.
** They are organized in the same way that the code asks for 'data category'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1. The first prompt is to provide file path that includes census CSV files. 
		This is the very first file path at the top of these instructions.
		
Step 2. Select the variable type of interest by typing number corresponding to data
		category. eg. Type 1 for Demographics
		
	Step 2b. Describe whether you want ACS or DEC variables
	
	Step 2c. Describe if for which year you want variables from.
	
Step 3. Type the Geo.id of interest. Variables useful for the study can be found
		in the 'MenhoodVariablesList_v3.xlsx' excel sheet
		
Step 4. Provide the name of the new shapefile you want to create. 
		CAUTION -- do not add an .shp, just the name of the name you want to give the file

Step 5. Provide the full file path, including the shapefile (with .shp) that you 
		want to use to make a new shapefile with.

Step 6. Provide the file path where you want to save your new shapefile

*** Small additional steps.

Step 7. At present the code has trouble writing out to the research drive.
		To remedy this, the manually coding the final line (below), and writing the 
		file out to a user's desktop seems to work.
		
		arcpy.CopyFeatures_management(CensusLyr,PathToSaveNewShapefileTo)
		
		** Use the CensusLyr Variable name, which has already been saved in the kernel
		at this point, and then write the string to the new filepath to save the shapfile
		to.


Step 8. For reasons I am still trying to figure out, the new feature layer's variables
		are being saved to the shapefile used to create a new shapefile with. So to not
		create outputs with additional variables not desired after each iteration, it may
		be of interest to use the delete fields function over the original shapefile and 
		get rid of those fields that were selected.
